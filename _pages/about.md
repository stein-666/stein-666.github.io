Hi, I am Tongcheng Fang, currently a master’s student in the [NICS-EFC Lab](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) ([EffAlg](https://nics-effalg.com/)) at the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University. I’m now advised by [Professor Wang Yu](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/YuWang), [Professor Ding Wenbo](https://ssr-group.net/), and [Dr. Ning Xuefei](https://nics-effalg.com/ningxuefei/). My research focuses on efficient visual generation, and recently, I’ve also become interested in agent systems. I welcome opportunities for collaboration or discussion—feel free to reach out!
